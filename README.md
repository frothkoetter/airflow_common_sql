## Lab 3 - Managed Tables

Run “CREATE TABLE AS SELECT” queries to create full ACID ORC type of the tables. This creates curated versions of the data which are optimal for BI usage.

*Do all these steps in the* **“db\_user001”..”db\_user020”** *unless otherwise noted.*

```sql
drop table if exists airlines_orc;
create table airlines_orc as select * from airlines_csv;

drop table if exists airports_orc;
create table airports_orc as select * from airports_csv;

drop table if exists planes_orc;
create table planes_orc as select * from planes_csv;

drop table if exists flights_orc;
create table flights_orc partitioned by (year) as
select year, month, dayofmonth, dayofweek, deptime, crsdeptime, arrtime, crsarrtime, uniquecarrier, flightnum, tailnum, actualelapsedtime, crselapsedtime, airtime, arrdelay, depdelay, origin, dest, distance, taxiin, taxiout, cancelled, cancellationcode, diverted, carrierdelay, weatherdelay, nasdelay, securitydelay, lateaircraftdelay
from flights_csv;

```

This takes a few minutes to read and write the data back.

Check that you created managed & external tables

```sql
USE DB_USER0**;
SHOW TABLES;
```

Results

|TAB_NAME|
| :- |
|airlines_csv|
|airlines_orc|
|airports_csv|
|airports_orc|
|flights_csv|
|flights_orc|
|planes_csv|
|planes_orc|

The DESCRIBE cmd shows detailed information about the table.

 ```sql
 DESCRIBE formatted flights_orc ;
 ```

Result: column names with types, parameters and storage

|col_name| data_type| comment|
| :- | :- |:- |
|month| int| |
|dayofmonth| int| |
|dayofweek| int| |
...

Scrol down to row 46

| | numFiles| 14 |
| :- | :- |:- |
| | numPartitions| 14 |
| | numRows| 86399321  |

 ```sql
show partitions flights_orc;
 ```
Result: showing all 14 partitions with keys

| partition |
| :- |
|year=1995|
|year=1996|
|year=1997|
|...|
|year=2008|

Experiment with different queries to see effects of the columnar storage format and cache.

QUERY: Airline Delay Aggregate Metrics by Airplane on managed table

```sql
SELECT
  tailnum,
  count(*) as flights_count,
  sum( nvl(depdelay,0) ) AS departure_delay_minutes,
  sum( case when nvl(depdelay,0) > 0 then 1 end) as departure_delay_count
FROM
  flights_orc
GROUP BY
  tailnum
ORDER BY
 departure_delay_minutes DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Results (same as previous query)
|tailnum	| flights_count | departure_delay_minutes |	 departure_delay_count|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|N381UA	| 25287 |341368 | 12280	|
|N375UA	| 25147 |341103	| 12162 |
|N673	| 30616 |333744	| 12835	|
|N366UA	| 24808 |331318	| 12113	|
|N377UA	| 25105 |328546	| 12163	|

Now let's compare this query select flights_orc managed table with the previous query for the flights_csv external table.

The Hive Query Processors can compare the queries. You navigate to the Query Processor via on the left side you click on Jobs, next is to click on Queries.

Next is to select the two queries, hoover over the SQL command and search the FROM clause with flights_csv and flights_orc.

When you found the SQL queries next is to check the box to click compare.

Here you see the two queries side-by-side with all details.
![](images/image002.png)

Query: Find all international flights: flights where destination airport country is not the same as origin airport country

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
   flightnum,
   uniquecarrier,
   origin,
   dest,
   month,
   dayofmonth,
   `dayofweek`
FROM
  flights_orc f,
   airports_orc oa,
   airports_orc da  
WHERE
   f.origin = oa.iata
   and f.dest = da.iata
   And oa.country <> da.country
ORDER BY
   month ASC,
   dayofmonth ASC;
```



### Defaults - Surrogate_key & Sequence

Surrogate keys are easy & distributable & fast, but not in sequence, has gaps.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS airlines_with_surrogate_key;

CREATE TABLE
  airlines_with_surrogate_key (
    ID BIGINT DEFAULT SURROGATE_KEY(),
    CODE STRING,
    DESCRIPTION STRING);

INSERT INTO airlines_with_surrogate_key (CODE, DESCRIPTION)
SELECT
  code,
  description
FROM
  airlines_csv;

SELECT
 *
FROM  
 airlines_with_surrogate_key
ORDER BY
 id
LIMIT 3;
```

Result:

|id	| code |	 description|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1099511627776 |02Q |Titan Airways |
|1099511627777 |04Q |Tradewind Aviation |
|1099511627778 |05Q |"Comlux Aviation |

Note: the first column is the new unique SURROGATE_KEY

### Optional Step - Create a SEQUENCE

```sql
CREATE TABLE AIRLINES_with_SEQ (
 ID BIGINT,
 CODE STRING,
 DESCRIPTION STRING);

INSERT INTO AIRLINES_with_SEQ (
  ID, CODE, DESCRIPTION)
 SELECT
  row_number() over(),
  CODE,
  DESCRIPTION
 from
  AIRLINES_CSV;

select
 *
from
 AIRLINES_with_SEQ
limit 3;
```

Result:

|id	| code |	 description|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1 |02Q |Titan Airways |
|2 |04Q |Tradewind Aviation |
|3 |05Q |"Comlux Aviation |

-----
## Lab 4 - Materialized View
Reminder: use your own “db\_user001”..”db\_user020” database.

Materialized views (MV) cause Hive to transparently rewrite queries, when possible, to use the MV instead of the base tables.

Create Materialized View of a join of two tables with aggregation.

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS traffic_cancel_airlines;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW
 traffic_cancel_airlines
AS SELECT
 airlines.code AS code,  
 airlines.description AS airline_name,
 flights.month AS month,
 COUNT(*) as flights_count,
 SUM(flights.cancelled) AS cancelled,
 SUM( nvl(depdelay,0) ) AS departure_delay_minutes,
 SUM( case when nvl(depdelay,0) > 0 then 1 end) as departure_delay_count
FROM
 flights_orc flights
 JOIN
  airlines_orc airlines ON (flights.uniquecarrier = airlines.code)
group by
 airlines.code,
 airlines.description,
 flights.month;
```
Note: The time to create the MV takes apporox. 3-5 minutes.

Checking that the materialized view is created.

```sql
SHOW MATERIALIZED VIEWS;
```

Results

|MV_NAME | REWRITE_ENABLED |  MODE  | incremental_rebuild |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|traffic_cancel_airlines|Yes	| Manual refresh | Available |

Running a query for part of the materialized view.

```sql
SELECT
 airlines.description AS description,
 SUM(flights.cancelled) AS flights_cancelled
FROM
 flights_orc flights ,
 airlines_orc airlines
WHERE
 flights.uniquecarrier = airlines.code
group by
 airlines.description;
```

Navigate to the query processor, select the above query and the visual explain you see query rewrite:

## Lab 5 - Time Travel and Partition Evolution

Cloudera Iceberg is a high-performance format for huge analytic tables for engines like Spark, Impala Flink and Hive to safely work with the same tables, at the same time.

Creating a partitioned table with CREATE TABLE ... PARTITIONED BY & STORED BY ICEBERG syntax enables you to create identity-partitioned Iceberg tables. Identity-partitioned Iceberg tables are similar to the regular partitioned tables and are stored in the same directory structure as the regular partitioned tables.

Lets create a new table with Iceberg format and insert rows in batches:

```sql
drop table if exists flights_ice;
create table flights_ice(
 year int, month int, dayofmonth int,  
 dayofweek int, deptime int, crsdeptime int, arrtime int,  
 crsarrtime int, uniquecarrier string, flightnum int, tailnum string,  
 actualelapsedtime int, crselapsedtime int, airtime int, arrdelay int,  
 depdelay int, origin string, dest string, distance int, taxiin int,  
 taxiout int, cancelled int, cancellationcode string, diverted string,  
 carrierdelay int, weatherdelay int, nasdelay int, securitydelay int,  
 lateaircraftdelay int )
 stored by ICEBERG;

insert into flights_ice (year, month, dayofmonth, dayofweek, deptime, crsdeptime, arrtime, crsarrtime,uniquecarrier, flightnum, tailnum, actualelapsedtime, crselapsedtime, airtime, arrdelay, depdelay,origin, dest, distance, taxiin, taxiout, cancelled, cancellationcode, diverted, carrierdelay, weatherdelay,nasdelay, securitydelay, lateaircraftdelay )
select year, month, dayofmonth, dayofweek, deptime, crsdeptime, arrtime, crsarrtime, uniquecarrier, flightnum, tailnum, actualelapsedtime, crselapsedtime, airtime, arrdelay, depdelay, origin, dest, distance, taxiin, taxiout, cancelled, cancellationcode, diverted, carrierdelay, weatherdelay, nasdelay, securitydelay, lateaircraftdelay
from flights_orc where year = 1995 and month <= 6;

insert into flights_ice (year, month, dayofmonth, dayofweek, deptime, crsdeptime, arrtime, crsarrtime,uniquecarrier, flightnum, tailnum, actualelapsedtime, crselapsedtime, airtime, arrdelay, depdelay,origin, dest, distance, taxiin, taxiout, cancelled, cancellationcode, diverted, carrierdelay, weatherdelay,nasdelay, securitydelay, lateaircraftdelay )
select year,month, dayofmonth, dayofweek, deptime, crsdeptime, arrtime, crsarrtime, uniquecarrier, flightnum, tailnum, actualelapsedtime, crselapsedtime, airtime, arrdelay, depdelay, origin, dest, distance, taxiin, taxiout, cancelled, cancellationcode, diverted, carrierdelay, weatherdelay, nasdelay, securitydelay, lateaircraftdelay
from flights_orc where year = 1995 and month > 6;
```

Now all rows for one year inserted into the table flights_ice.

Check the count of all rows inserted previouly:

```sql
select
 count(*) row_count
from
 flights_ice;
```

Result:

| row_count |
| :- |
| 5437433|



*Enter the your_dbname as **“db\_user001”..”db\_user020”** in this HUE parameter field

![](images/cdw-lab5-para01.png)

Now select the snapshot history of the table.

```sql
select * from ${your_dbname}.flights_ice.history;
```

Result: two snapshots of the table in the output, one for each insert command.

|FLIGHTS.MADE_CURRENT_AT |	FLIGHTS_ICE.SNAPSHOT_ID	|FLIGHTS.PARENT_ID	|FLIGHTS.IS_CURRENT_ANCESTOR|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
2022-05-01 09:29:12.509 Z|	7097750832501567062 | null | true |
2022-05-01 09:56:21.464 Z|	5696129515471947086 | 7097750832501567062 | true |


Let's make a quick time travel to one of the versions using SYSTEM_VERSION or SYSTEM_TIME.

Pick the number of FLIGHTS_ICE.SNAPSHOT_ID from the first row and replace ***SNAPSHOT_ID***

```sql
select
 count(*) as row_count
from
 flights_ice
FOR
 SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF ***SNAPSHOT_ID***
group by
 year
order by
 year;
```

Result: Only data from the first insert.

|  row_count |
| :- |
| 2783584 |


Partition Evolution is a feature when table layout can be updated as data or queries change and  users are not required to maintain partition columns.

![](images/IcebergPartitionEvo.png)

With Iceberg’s hidden partitions the tables separation between physical and logical users avoid reading unnecessary partitions and don’t need to know how the table is partitioned and add extra filters to their queries.

Lets change the partition schema to YEAR & MONTH & DAYOFMONTH

```sql
alter table flights_ice SET PARTITION SPEC (year ,month, dayofmonth);
```

Now let's insert one day of data into the partitioned table:
```sql
insert into flights_ice (year, month, dayofmonth, dayofweek, deptime, crsdeptime, arrtime, crsarrtime,uniquecarrier, flightnum, tailnum, actualelapsedtime, crselapsedtime, airtime, arrdelay, depdelay,origin, dest, distance, taxiin, taxiout, cancelled, cancellationcode, diverted, carrierdelay, weatherdelay,nasdelay, securitydelay, lateaircraftdelay )
select 2023, 1, 1 , dayofweek, deptime, crsdeptime, arrtime, crsarrtime, uniquecarrier, flightnum, tailnum, actualelapsedtime, crselapsedtime, airtime, arrdelay, depdelay, origin, dest, distance, taxiin, taxiout, cancelled, cancellationcode, diverted, carrierdelay, weatherdelay, nasdelay, securitydelay, lateaircraftdelay
from flights_orc where year = 1995 and month = 1 and dayofmonth = 1;
```
Now lets see the impact what the difference is, lets run two queries and note the complete time:

Count the records for one year and month that is inserted before the partition:
```sql
select
  count(1) as row_count,
  sum(depdelay)
from
  flights_ice
where  
  year = 1995 and month = 1 and dayofmonth = 1;
```

Run the second query for the data last inserted into the partition:
```sql
select
count(1) as row_count,
sum(depdelay)
from
  flights_ice
where  
  year = 2023 and month = 1 and dayofmonth = 1;
 ```

You can compare the two queries in the HUE Query Processor tool. The second query has reads only the small partitioned file and you notice the difference in the DAG Swimlane tab:

![](images/image0252.png)

More details on the DAG Counter tab:

![](images/image0251.png)
Note: check on Hide Equal Values to see only changed values

This example shows that the execution time is greatly decreased because less data was read.

## Lab 6 - Data Quality with Branching
*Enter the your_dbname as **“db\_user001”..”db\_user020”** in this HUE parameter field

The quality of data holds immense importance within any data engineering process, directly influencing subsequent analytical tasks like business intelligence and machine learning. It is imperative to conduct thorough testing, cleansing and validation of data at every stage of the data pipeline before deployment into the production.

The QA pipeline looks like the following:
![](images/cdw-lab6-qa001a.png)

The QA steps are test, cleanse, validate and propergate to production.

In this lab we go through these steps for the AIRPORTS table.


1) uniqueness of the IATA codes

2) length of field IATA should be always 3

3) no quotation marks in the field AIRPORT



*Enter the your_dbname as **“db\_user001”..”db\_user020”** in this HUE parameter field

![](images/cdw-lab6-qa002.png)

Begin with the creation of ICEBERG V2 table with the raw data and run the first test checking uniqueness of the IATA code:

```sql
drop table if exists ${your_dbname}.airports_ice;
create table ${your_dbname}.airports_ice stored by iceberg TBLPROPERTIES('format-version'='2')
as select * from ${your_dbname}.airports_csv;

/*
** QA test:  iata unique values   
*/
select
      count(*) as failures,
      count(*) != 0 as should_warn,
      count(*) != 0 as should_error
    from (
select
    iata as unique_field,
    count(*) as n_records
from airports_ice
where iata is not null
group by iata
having count(*) > 1
) iata_unique_test;
```

The output should like this not reporting any duplicate IATA codes.

| failures | should_warn | should_error |
| :- | :- |  :- |
|0 | false |	false |

Now running the 2nd test of the field length for the IATA code that must be 3:
```sql
/*
** test iata len = 3
*/
select
      count(*) as failures,
      count(*) != 0 as should_warn,
      count(*) != 0 as should_error
from (
      with validation as (
	                         select iata as field
	                          from airports_ice
                         ),
                         validation_errors as (
	   select field from validation
	    where LENGTH(field) != 3
                        )
select *
from validation_errors
) iata_length_test;
```

The test shows that 42 rows are not having the correct length.

|failures |	should_warn	| should_error |
| :- | :- |  :- |
| 42 |	true |	true |


Running the 3rd test and find quotation marks in the field AIRPORT

```sql
/*
**  QA test: quotation marks in fields
*/
select
      count(*) as failures,
      count(*) >10 as should_warn,
      count(*) >1000 as should_error
    from (
with validation as (
	select airport as field
	from airports_ice
),
validation_errors as (
	select field from validation
	where field rlike('"')
)
select *
from validation_errors
) quotation_marks_test;
```

The Output is 373 rows with quotation marks in the field AIRPORT and there is a warning and error level.

NOTE: it's good practice to have a warning level i.e. here 10 rows may is acceptable and does not require cleaning.

|failures |	should_warn	| should_error |
| :- | :- |  :- |
| 373 |	true |	false |

This last test showing a WARNING and we data should clean the data.  

Now we know what exactly do we create a branch with the name QA.
```SQL
/*
** create branch  
*/
ALTER TABLE airports_ice CREATE BRANCH qa;

select * from ${your_dbname}.airports_ice.refs;
```

The list of branches are as follows:

|name	|type	|snapshot_id |	max_reference_age_in_ms |	min_snapshots_to_keep	| max_snapshot_age_in_ms |
| :- | :- |  :- | :- | :- |  :- |
|qa	|BRANCH	|4861947596552380217	|NULL	|NULL	|NULL|
|main	|BRANCH	|4861947596552380217	|NULL	|NULL	|NULL

The main branch always exists a base when creating the Iceberg table.

Now do the cleaning job and delete rows where the IATA code is != 3 and remove the quotation marks from the AIRPORT field.

```SQL
/*
** Data Cleansing: data transformations
*/
delete from ${your_dbname}.airports_ice.branch_qa
where LENGTH(iata) != 3;

update ${your_dbname}.airports_ice.branch_qa
set airport = regexp_replace( airport ,'"','')
where airport rlike('"');
```

Output should like this:

 Success.

Next is to validate the data we have cleansed to be on the save side.

```SQL
 /*
 ** Validate: not iata len <> 3
 */
 select
       count(*) as failures,
       count(*) != 0 as should_warn,
       count(*) > 100 as should_error
 from (
       with validation as (
 	                         select iata as field
 	                          from ${your_dbname}.airports_ice.branch_qa
                          ),
 validation_errors as (
 	select field from validation
 	where LENGTH(field) != 3
 )
 select *
 from validation_errors
 ) iata_length_test;
```

Output looks good:

 |failures |	should_warn	| should_error |
 | :- | :- |  :- |
 | 0 |	false |	false |

Run the 2nd validation

 ```SQL
 /*
 **  validation: no quotation marks in Field
 */
 select
       count(*) as failures,
       count(*) >10 as should_warn,
       count(*) >1000 as should_error
     from (
 with validation as (
 	select airport as field
 	from ${your_dbname}.airports_ice.branch_qa
 ),
 validation_errors as (
 	select field from validation
 	where field rlike('"')
 )
 select *
 from validation_errors
 ) quotation_marks_validation;
```
Output looks good:

|failures |	should_warn	| should_error |
| :- | :- |  :- |
| 0 |	false |	false |

Both validations show no failures and we can move the data from the QA branch into the main branch and drop the QA branch for housekeeping.

 ```SQL
ALTER table airports_ice EXECUTE FAST-FORWARD 'qa';

ALTER TABLE airports_ice DROP BRANCH if exists qa;

select * from ${your_dbname}.airports_ice.refs;
```

Output:

|name	|type	|snapshot_id |	max_reference_age_in_ms |	min_snapshots_to_keep	| max_snapshot_age_in_ms |
| :- | :- |  :- | :- | :- |  :- |
|main	|BRANCH	|4861947596552380217	|NULL	|NULL	|NULL


This lab you saw how Iceberg branching feature helping data quality pipelines in a data engineering workflow.

## Lab 7 - Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) - TYPE 2

*Do all these steps in the* **“db\_user001”..”db\_user020”** *unless otherwise noted.*

This lab demonstrates a comprehensive merge operation using ACID tables in Hive, including the ability to update, insert, and delete rows within a single transaction.

A Type 2 SCD retains the full history of values. When the value of a chosen attribute changes, the current record is closed. A new record is created with the changed data values and this new record becomes the current record.

![](images/cdw-lab7-001.png)

We create a new SDC table ***airline\_scd*** and add columns ***valid\_from*** and ***valid\_to***. Then loading the initial into this SDC table, then mock up new data and change data in the table ***airlines\_stage***.

Create the Hive managed table for airlines. Load initial by copy 1000 rows of current airlines with hard code the valid_from date

```sql
drop table if exists airlines_scd;

create table airlines_scd(code string, description string, updated_at timestamp, valid_from timestamp, valid_to timestamp);

insert into airlines_scd
    select *, current_date(), cast('2021-01-01' as timestamp), cast('9999-01-01' as timestamp)
    from airlines_csv;

```

Create an external staging table pointing to our complete airlines dataset (1491 records), add one row, update a description and delete two rows to mockup a change in the dimension

```sql
drop table if exists airlines_stage;

create table airlines_stage as select * from airlines_csv;

insert into airlines_stage
   values ('FFF','New Airline');

update airlines_stage
set
 description = concat('Update - ',upper(description))
where
 code in ('02Q');

delete from airlines_stage
 where
   code in ('04Q');
```

Finally merging these two tables with a single MERGE command to maintain the historical data and check the results.

```sql
merge into airlines_scd as target
using  (
select
   'update - change the old row' as ops,
   source.code as join_key,
   source.code,
   source.description
   from
    airlines_stage as source
   where exists (
            select 1 from airlines_scd as target
               where source.code = target.code
               and  source.description <> target.description )
union all
select
   'update - insert row' as ops,
    null as join_key,
    airlines_stage.code,
    airlines_stage.description
 from
   airlines_stage join airlines_scd on airlines_stage.code = airlines_scd.code
 where
   ( airlines_stage.description <> airlines_scd.description )
union all
select
    'insert' as ops,
    null as join_key,
    source.code,
    source.description
  from
    airlines_stage as source
  where not exists (
        select 1 from airlines_scd as target
          where target.code = source.code)
union all
select
    'delete' as cmd,
    target.code as join_key,
    target.code,
    target.description
  from
      airlines_scd as target
  where not exists (
        select 1 from airlines_stage as source
          where target.code = source.code)
) source
on source.join_key = target.code
when matched
 then update
    set valid_to = current_timestamp(), updated_at = current_timestamp()
when not matched
 then insert
    values (source.code, source.description, current_timestamp(), current_timestamp(), cast('9999-01-01' as timestamp) );
```

View the changed records and see that the VALID_FROM and VALID_TO dates are set

```sql
select
  code,
  description,
  valid_from,
  valid_to
from
  airlines_scd
 where code in ('02Q','04Q','FFF')
 order by
  code asc,
  valid_from;
```

## Lab 7 - Data Security & Governance

The combination of the Data Warehouse with SDX offers a list of powerful features like rule-based masking columns based on a user’s role and/or group association or rule-based row filters.

For this workshop we are going to explore Attribute-Based Access Control a.k.a. Tage-based security policies.

First we are going to create a series of tables in your work database.

In the SQL editor, select your database and run this script:

```sql
CREATE TABLE emp_fname (id int, fname string);
insert into emp_fname(id, fname) values (1, 'Carl'),(2, 'Clarence');

CREATE TABLE emp_lname (id int, lname string);
insert into emp_lname(id, lname) values (1, 'Rickenbacker'), (2, 'Fender');

CREATE TABLE emp_age (id int, age smallint);
insert into emp_age(id, age) values (1, 35),(2, 55);

CREATE TABLE emp_denom (id int, denom char(2), email string);
insert into emp_denom(id, denom, email) values (1, 'rk','cr@yahoo.com'),(2, 'na','cfender@gmail.com');

CREATE TABLE emp_id (id int, empid integer);
insert into emp_id(id, empid) values (1, 1146651),(2, 239125);

CREATE TABLE emp_all as
  (select a.id, a.fname, b.lname, c.age, d.denom,d.email,e.empid from emp_fname a
	inner join emp_lname b on b.id = a.id
	inner join emp_age c on c.id = b.id
	inner join emp_denom d on d.id = c.id
	inner join emp_id e on e.id = d.id);

create table emp_younger as (select * from emp_all where emp_all.age <= 45);

create table emp_older as (select * from emp_all where emp_all.age > 45);
```

After this script executes, a simple

```sql
select * from emp_all;
```

… should give the contents of the emp\_all table, which only has a couple of lines of data.

For the next step we will switch to the UI of Atlas, the CDP component responsible for metadata management and governance: in the Cloudera Data Warehouse *Overview* UI, select Database Catalog. Click on the three-dot menu of this DB catalog and select “Open Atlas” in the associated pop-up menu:

![](images/RangerUIOpen.png)

This should open the Atlas UI. CDP comes with a newer, improved user interface which can be enabled through the __“Switch to Beta”__ item in the user menu on the upper right corner of the screen. Do this now.

The Atlas UI has a left column which lists the Entities, Classifications, Business Metadata and Glossaries that belong to your CDP Environment.

![](images/Aspose.Words.10bb90cf-0d99-47f3-a995-23ef2b90be86.007.png)

We just created a couple of tables in the Data Warehouse, let’s look at the associated metadata. Under “Entities”, click on “hive\_db”. This should produce a list of databases.
Select you workshop database, this will result in the database’s metadata being displayed.

Select the “Tables” tab (the rightmost)
![](images/Aspose.Words.10bb90cf-0d99-47f3-a995-23ef2b90be86.008.png)

Select the “emp\_all” table from the list, this will result in Atlas displaying the metadata for this table; select the “lineage” tab:
   ![](images/Aspose.Words.10bb90cf-0d99-47f3-a995-23ef2b90be86.009.png)
This lineage graph shows the inputs, outputs as well as the processing steps resulting from the execution of our SQL code in the Data Warehouse.

The red circle marks the currently selected entity. Atlas will always display the current entity's type in braces next to the entity name (middle, top of the page, e.g. "hive_table"). Clicking on one of the nodes will display a popup menu, which allows us to navigate through the lineage graph.

# Bonus Material (optional)

## 9 - Continues Data Pipeline

During the workshop every minute new streaming flight events are
 - created
 - enriched with realtime weather information and with the prediction of the delay
 - stored in Iceberg table

![](images/image025.png)

The steps in this optional lab are as follows:
 - Create flights_final table, a offset table and a temporary table
 - Populate and transform the data from the raw streaming table into the temporary table
 - Sweep transformed data and save meta data of the micro batch in the offset table


Create the table of the final streaming events with additional columns for weather information and delay prediction:

```sql
drop table if exists flights_final;
create table flights_final
(
 year int, month int, dayofmonth int,
 dayofweek int, deptime int, crsdeptime int, arrtime int,
 crsarrtime int, uniquecarrier string, flightnum int, tailnum string,
 actualelapsedtime int, crselapsedtime int, airtime int, arrdelay int,
 depdelay int, origin string, dest string, distance int, taxiin int,
 taxiout int, cancelled int, cancellationcode string, diverted string,
 carrierdelay int, weatherdelay int, nasdelay int, securitydelay int, lateaircraftdelay int,
 origin_lon string,origin_lat string, dest_lon string,dest_lat string,
 prediction decimal,proba  decimal,prediction_delay  decimal,
 temp decimal, pressure decimal,humidity decimal,wind_speed decimal, clouds string,
 batch_id BIGINT )
stored by ICEBERG;
```

Create a table for the meta data of the micro batch, as batch_id, offset pointer and row count of the events processed:

```sql
drop table if exists flights_batch_offset;
create table flights_batch_offset(
 batch_id bigint DEFAULT SURROGATE_KEY(), run_ts timestamp,
 from_ts bigint,
 to_ts bigint,
 row_count bigint);
```
Note: the Default surrogate_key() creates new unique number when new rows inserted

Next is to create a temporary table of the new format (including prediction and weather)
```sql
drop table if exists flights_streaming__tmp;
create temporary table flights_streaming__tmp
(
 year int, month int, dayofmonth int,
 dayofweek int, deptime int, crsdeptime int, arrtime int,
 crsarrtime int, uniquecarrier string, flightnum int, tailnum string,
 actualelapsedtime int, crselapsedtime int, airtime int, arrdelay int,
 depdelay int, origin string, dest string, distance int, taxiin int,
 taxiout int, cancelled int, cancellationcode string, diverted string,
 carrierdelay int, weatherdelay int, nasdelay int, securitydelay int, lateaircraftdelay int,
 origin_lon string,origin_lat string, dest_lon string,dest_lat string,
 prediction decimal,proba  decimal,prediction_delay  decimal,
 temp decimal, pressure decimal,humidity decimal,wind_speed decimal, clouds string);
```

Now we populate the temporary table with new events from the raw streaming:
```sql
with flights as ( select
  year, month, dayofmonth, dayofweek, deptime, crsdeptime, arrtime, crsarrtime, uniquecarrier, flightnum, tailnum,
  actualelapsedtime, crselapsedtime, airtime, arrdelay, depdelay, origin, dest, cast( distance as integer ) as distance, taxiin, taxiout,
  cancelled, cancellationcode, diverted, carrierdelay, weatherdelay, nasdelay, securitydelay, lateaircraftdelay,
  origin_lon, origin_lat, cast( dest_lon as float) as dest_lon, cast(dest_lat as float) as dest_lat,
  cast( translate( substr(prediction, instr(prediction,'prediction=')+11,1 ),'}','') as integer),
  cast( translate( substr(prediction, instr(prediction,'proba=')+6,4 ),'}','') as float),
  cast( translate( substr(prediction, instr(prediction,'prediction_delay=')+17,2 ),',','') as integer) ,
  cast( translate( substr( weather_json, instr(weather_json,'temp=')+5,5 ),',','') as float) ,
  cast( translate( substr( weather_json, instr(weather_json,'pressure=')+9,6 ),',','') as float) ,
  cast( translate( substr( weather_json, instr(weather_json,'humidity=')+9,2 ),',','') as float) ,
  cast( translate( substr( weather_json, instr(weather_json,'speed=')+6,5 ),',','') as float) ,
  cast( translate( substr( weather_json, instr(weather_json,'all=')+4,3 ),'}','') as string)
 from
  airlinedata.flights_streaming_ice
  ),
offset as ( select max(to_ts) as max_ts from flights_batch_offset)
insert into flights_streaming__tmp
  select
    flights.*
  from
   flights, offset
   where  
     unix_timestamp(concat( year,'-', month, '-', dayofmonth, ' ' ,
       substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),1,2),':', substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),3,2) ,':00' )) > nvl(max_ts,0);
```

Maintain the offset and create a new batch_id and meta data about the batch content into the offset table:

```SQL
insert into flights_batch_offset(run_ts,from_ts,to_ts,row_count)
select
 current_timestamp(),
 min( unix_timestamp(concat( year,'-', month, '-', dayofmonth, ' ' ,
   substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),1,2),':', substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),3,2) ,':00' ))),
 max( unix_timestamp(concat( year,'-', month, '-', dayofmonth, ' ' ,
   substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),1,2),':', substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),3,2) ,':00' ))),
 count(1)
from
flights_streaming__tmp;
```

Finally swept events into the flights_final table:

```SQL
with ingest as ( select * from flights_streaming__tmp),
     offset as ( select max(batch_id) from flights_batch_offset)
insert into flights_final
select
 ingest.*,
 offset.*
from
 ingest,
 offset;
```
Clean up as good housekeeping is;
```SQL
drop table if exists flights_streaming__tmp;
```

Lets run two checks, checking the offset table
```sql
select
 run_ts,
 from_unixtime(from_ts) as ingest_from,
 from_unixtime(to_ts) as ingest_to,  
 row_count as total_process
from
 flights_batch_offset;
```
There should be one row of the previous ingest
| run_ts | ingest_from | ingest_to     | total_process |
| :------------- | :------------- |:------------- |:------------- |
| 2023-05-22 12:45:50.832883 | 2023-05-22 10:14:00   | 	2023-05-22 12:38:00 | 	4020 |

Let's run a SQL query of a 15 minutes tumbling window:
```sql
with tumbling_window as (
 SELECT
  from_unixtime(
   floor(
    unix_timestamp(concat( year,'-', month, '-', dayofmonth, ' ' ,substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),1,2),':', substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),3,2) ,':00' ))
     / (15 * 60)) * (15 * 60)) AS window_start,
  from_unixtime(floor(unix_timestamp(concat( year,'-', month, '-', dayofmonth, ' ' ,substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),1,2),':', substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),3,2) ,':00' )) / (15 * 60)) * (15 * 60) + (15 * 60)) AS window_end,
  COUNT(*) AS count
 FROM
  flights_final
 GROUP BY
  floor(unix_timestamp(concat( year,'-', month, '-', dayofmonth, ' ' ,substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),1,2),':', substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),3,2) ,':00' )) / (15 * 60))
)
select * from tumbling_window
order by 1 desc;
```

The output should like this for every 15 minutes window

| window_start    | window_end    | count |
| :------------- | :------------- |:-------------
| 2023-05-22 10:30:00	| 2023-05-22 10:45:00	| 423 |
| 2023-05-22 10:15:00 |	2023-05-22 10:30:00	| 405 |
(more rows ... )

## 10 Data Mart / Cubes

In earlier Above examples you had two dimensions with origin and dest, now you add a third dimension with the time i.e. year. The data set you start to analyze has become a real cube with three dimensions as here airlinedata as multi dimension cube.


![](images/image0271.png)


Lets define the table for the cube:

```sql
drop table if exists airport_delayed_flights;
create table airport_delayed_flights (
 daytime string,
 dest_airport_iata string,
 dest_city  string,
 dest_temp  decimal,
 dest_wind_speed decimal,
 dest_pressure  decimal,
 predicted_delayed int,
 predicted_delay_min int);
 ```

Create a job with the query scheduler to run the query every 15 minute:

```sql
-- drop scheduled query airport_delayed_flights;
create scheduled query airport_delayed_flights cron '0 */15 * * * ? *' defined as
insert overwrite airlinedata.airport_delayed_flights
SELECT
  date_format( from_unixtime( ( unix_timestamp(concat( year,'-', month, '-', dayofmonth, ' ' ,
        substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),1,2),':', substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),3,2) ,':00' )))) , 'yyyy/MM/dd HH:00:00'),
   flights.dest as destination_airport,
   airports.city as destination_city,
    max(flights.temp) as dest_temp,
    max(flights.wind_speed) as dest_wind_speed,
    max(flights.pressure) as dest_pressure,
    sum(flights.prediction) AS predicted_delayed,
    sum(flights.prediction_delay) AS predicted_delay_min
FROM
   airlinedata.flights_final flights,
   airlinedata.airports_orc airports
WHERE
    flights.dest = airports.iata
GROUP BY
   date_format( from_unixtime( ( unix_timestamp(concat( year,'-', month, '-', dayofmonth, ' ' ,
        substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),1,2),':', substring(lpad(deptime,4,'0'),3,2) ,':00' )))) , 'yyyy/MM/dd HH:00:00'),
   flights.dest ,
   airports.city ;
```

Lets enable and check that the job is created:
```sql
alter scheduled query airport_delayed_flights enable;
select
  schedule_name,
  enabled,
  next_execution,
  query  
from
  information_schema.scheduled_queries
where
  `user` = current_user();
```
The query output should be like this:

|schedule_name	|enabled	|next_execution	|query |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|airport_delayed_flights | true | 2023-05-15 17:55:00 | insert overwrite airlinedata.airport_delayed_flights SELECT  .... |

Next step is activated job to kick off executions, check the status:
```sql
alter scheduled query airport_delayed_flights execute;
with job_runs as (select
 schedule_name,
 state,
 start_time,
 elapsed
from
  information_schema.scheduled_executions )
select
 job_runs.*
from
  information_schema.scheduled_queries jobs
join job_runs
  on
   `user` = current_user()
  and
   jobs.schedule_name = job_runs.schedule_name;
  ```
You see the job finished status:

|job_runs.schedule_name	|job_runs.state	|job_runs.start_time	|job_runs.elapsed|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|airport_delayed_flights | FINISHED | 2023-05-15 17:48:06 | 3 |


Check that rows for Boston airport in the data mart:
```sql
select  
 *
from
 airport_delayed_flights
where
 dest_airport_iata = 'BOS'
order by 1 desc;
```

### Loadtest

Run load test to simulate adding many more end users. Then view results of autoscaling. Discuss how autoscaling works, and how it allows for easy, cost-effective scaling.

|-- Optional step. Can be just a discussion if no load test is actually done.|
| :- |

Discuss how workload aware autoscaling runs ETL style queries on dedicated executor group to not interfere with shorter queries.

|<p>-- Start the creation process for a Hive VW and see the **“Query Isolation” option.**</p><p>-- No need to continue to create the VW.</p>|

Clean Up
```sql
DROP DATABASE DBB_USER0** CASCADE;
```

### Hive Compaction

Hive compaction is a ‘subsystem’ within Hive to implement the most critical type of ACID housekeeping task: merging the delta changes together to reduce the read-path overhead of reading current state from across multiple deltas.

Compaction workflow is fully asynchronous:

![](images/images101.png)

There are two types of compaction.

Minor compaction merges deltas but does not merge original base.

![](images/images102.png)

Major compaction merges old base (if exists) with deltas - creates new base .
![](images/images103.png)

Let's see how Hive compaction works in practice.

```sql
describe formatted flights;
```
Search in the result the numFiles and numPartitions


|numFiles  |          	12  |                
|numPartitions  |     	12  |  

Now lets update the table and see the impact

```sql
update flights set taxiin = 1
where
 month = 1;

update flights set taxiin = 2
where
 month = 2;

describe formatted flights;
```

Search agin the numFiles and notice the numFiles is increased


|numFiles  |          	16  |                
|numPartitions  |     	12  |  

Now we start a manual compaction for the table partitions

```sql
alter table flights partition (month='1') compact 'major';
alter table flights partition (month='2') compact 'major';
```

This works asyncronus in the background can you can observe the status with

```sql
show compactions;
```

Results

| compactionid	| dbname | tabname | partname | type | state | workerhost | workerid | enqueuetime | starttime | duration | hadoopjobid | errormessage |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :-| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| 1 |	airlinedata_ws	| flights	| month=2 | MAJOR | succeeded | yjnam-yakurut-oozie-master0.se-sandb.a465-9q4k.cloudera.site | 66 | 1666787018950 | 1666787023591 | 62 | None | jk.svc.cluster.local |


When the compaction is completed you can lookup the numFiles and find the reduced number.

Compaction does helps with the small file problem as it eliminates the deltas and their buckets.

Compaction does NOT reduce the number of base buckets for the table/partition and the rows don’t move between buckets (which can lead to unbalanced data skew in the bucket files). A full table rewrites would solve this issue.


### HPLSQL - Database Applications

### Data Sketches

You can use Datasketch algorithms for queries that take too long to calculate exact results due to very large data sets (e.g. number of distinct values).

You may use data sketches (i.e. HLL algorithms) to generate approximate results that are much faster to retrieve. HLL is an algorithm that gives approximate answers for computing the number of distinct values in a column. The value returned by this algorithm is similar to the result of COUNT(DISTINCT col) and the NDV function integrated with Impala.

However, HLL algorithm is much faster than COUNT(DISTINCT col) and the NDV function and is less memory-intensive for columns with high cardinality.

Create a table for data sketch columns
```sql
drop table if exists airlinedata.flights_qt_sketch;

create table airlinedata.flights_qt_sketch as
select flights_orc.uniquecarrier AS airline_code,
 count(1) as sum_flights,
 ds_quantile_doubles_sketch(cast(arrdelay+1 as double)) as sk_arrdelay
FROM airlinedata.flights_orc
where arrdelay > 0
GROUP BY uniquecarrier;

```
Fast retrieval a few rows
```sql							 
select airline_code, ds_quantile_doubles_pmf(sk_arrdelay,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100)
from airlinedata.flights_qt_sketch;

```

Count distinct with HLL algorithm  

How many unique flights

```sql

drop table if exists airlinedata.flights_hll_sketch;							
create table airlinedata.flights_hll_sketch as
select ds_hll_sketch( cast(concat(flights_orc.uniquecarrier,flights_orc.flightnum) as string) ) AS flightnum_sk
FROM airlinedata.flights_orc;

select ds_hll_estimate(flightnum_sk)
from airlinedata.flights_hll_sketch;
```

#### Needle in Haystack - most frequency items - or better not on Alaska Airline Flight - AS65

Optional step. Can be just a discussion

What flights are most frequently cancelled

```sql
drop table if exists airlinedata.flights_frq_sketch; 					  
create table airlinedata.flights_frq_sketch (cancelled int, sk_flightnum binary);
insert into airlinedata.flights_frq_sketch
select flights_orc.cancelled, ds_freq_sketch( cast(concat(flights_orc.uniquecarrier,flights_orc.flightnum) as string), 8192 )
FROM airlinedata.flights_orc
GROUP BY flights_orc.cancelled;

select ds_freq_frequent_items(sk_flightnum, 'NO_FALSE_POSITIVES')
from airlinedata.flights_frq_sketch;
```

<p>Results</p><p>     </p>|


|ITEM|ESTIMATE|LOWER\_BOUND|UPPER\_BOUND|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|AS65|960|591|960|
|WN25|913|544|913|
|AS64|889|520|889|




validate the results

```sql
select concat(flights_orc.uniquecarrier,flights_orc.flightnum) as flight, count(1) as num_cancelled
from airlinedata.flights_orc
where uniquecarrier = 'AS' and flightnum = 65 and cancelled = 1
group by concat(flights_orc.uniquecarrier,flights_orc.flightnum)
order by num_cancelled desc;
```

Results

### Cryptographic Functions

Hive has support for AES functions to encrypt or decrypt individual columns.

In this example we create a new table: manufactors_crypt and store the field
manufactor from the plances_orc table in a encrypted AES format. The 2nd parameter
of the aes_encrypt or aes_decrypt functions are the secret key. The sixteen
character are good for a 128bit encryption, for 256bit use 32 characters.  

```sql
drop table if exists manufactors_crypt;

create table manufactors_crypt
(id BIGINT DEFAULT SURROGATE_KEY() , description_crypt string);

INSERT into manufactors_crypt( description_crypt )
select base64( aes_encrypt(manufacturer,'1234567890123456'))
from planes_orc
where planes_orc.manufacturer
is not NULL
group by manufacturer;

SELECT description_crypt, aes_decrypt(unbase64(description_crypt),
'1234567890123456') description
from manufactors_crypt
where description_crypt is not NULL;
```
